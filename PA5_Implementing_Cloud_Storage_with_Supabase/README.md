# Cloud Storage Implementation Guide

## What We're Building
Moving our app from storing files on our server to storing them in the cloud using Supabase.

## Why Cloud Storage?

**Problems with Local Storage:**
- Server runs out of space
- Files get lost when server crashes
- Slow loading for users far away

**Benefits of Cloud Storage:**
- Unlimited space
- Files are backed up automatically
- Fast loading worldwide
- Better security

## How It Works
1. User uploads a file
2. File goes directly to cloud storage
3. We save the file info in our database
4. Users can access files from anywhere

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Supabase Account
- Go to supabase.com
- Make a new project
- Choose a strong password
- Pick your region

### 2. Create Storage Buckets
- Go to Storage section
- Create "videos" bucket (make it public)
- Create "thumbnails" bucket (make it public)

### 3. Install Required Packages

**Backend:**
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### 4. Add Environment Variables

Create `.env` file with:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
SUPABASE_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Key Files to Create/Update
- `supabase.js` - Connection setup
- `uploadService.js` - Handle file uploads
- `videoController.js` - Manage video operations
- Upload page - User interface for uploads

## Testing
1. Upload a test video
2. Check if it appears in Supabase dashboard
3. Verify video plays correctly
4. Test from different devices
